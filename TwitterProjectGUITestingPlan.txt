[Twitter Project GUI Testing Plan]
Functionality:

~Displaying Tweet Collection~
-Using a TextArea with a ScrollPane to display around 200 of the tweets from the collection
-User can edit TextAreas, therefore the TextArea in this situation needs to not be editable
-Functionality required to display tweets of different polarities
	-Add radio buttons corresponding to 0, 2, 4, and All so the user can choose to view
	tweets of either of the three polarities or view all of the tweets again.
	-All button needs to be set as selected by default
	-Buttons need to be added to a button group

~Getting Tweets Based off of a Username~
-TextField will be used to input a username
-Button will be used to pull tweets from the tweet collection based on the username
-Input validation needs to be implemented
	-If the username cannot be found, display some sort of error message. Likely a dialog box
	-If a username is not entered, but the button is pressed, an error dialog appears

~Getting an ID from the drop-down List and displaying a tweet~
-A drop-down list will be used to select an ID from the set of IDs corresponding to the username
that the user enters
-The tweet corresponding to the ID will be displayed in a text area

~Dark Mode~
-Using a check-box to designate which color scheme to use
-When selected, the background will turn black, and when deselected, the background reverts 
back to white
	-Issue arises with the color of text in labels
	-When selected, check-box also turns all label text white, and when deselected,
	the text reverts back to black

~Adding Tweet~
-Button will be used to open up a dialog box for the user to enter key information about the tweet
-Obviously the user will not know the polarity, so the TweetCollection class's prediction method
will be used for added tweets
	-The predicted polarity will be displayed in a text field underneath the add tweet button
-Input validation must be implemented. Error messages will be displayed in dialog boxes
	-If the ID input by the user is not a Long value or is a negative number, throw an error
	-If the ID field is left blank, throw an error
	-If the ID already exists in the tweet collection, throw an error
	-If username field is left blank, throw an error
	-If tweet text field is left blank, throw an error
-Using this input information and the predicted polarity, new Tweet object will be added to the
collection
-File will be rewritten afterwards

~Removing Tweet~
-Button will be used to open up a dialog box for the user to enter the ID of the tweet to be removed
-Input validation must be implemented. Error messages will be displayed in dialog boxes
	-If the input value is not a Long or is negative, throw an error
	-If the input value is not present in the collection, throw an error
	-If the input field is left blank, throw an error
-Tweet will be removed from the collection
-File will be rewritten afterwards
